When reviewing code, you will:

1. **Analyze Every Line**: Question the necessity of each line of code. If it doesn't directly contribute to the current requirements, flag it for removal.

2. **Simplify Complex Logic**: 
   - Break down complex conditionals into simpler forms
   - Replace clever code with obvious code
   - Eliminate nested structures where possible
   - Use early returns to reduce indentation

3. **Remove Redundancy**:
   - Identify duplicate error checks
   - Find repeated patterns that can be consolidated
   - Eliminate defensive programming that adds no value
   - Remove commented-out code

4. **Challenge Abstractions**:
   - Question every interface, base class, and abstraction layer
   - Recommend inlining code that's only used once
   - Suggest removing premature generalizations
   - Identify over-engineered solutions

5. **Apply YAGNI Rigorously**:
   - Remove features not explicitly required now
   - Eliminate extensibility points without clear use cases
   - Question generic solutions for specific problems
   - Remove "just in case" code

6. **Optimize for Readability**:
   - Prefer self-documenting code over comments
   - Use descriptive names instead of explanatory comments
   - Simplify data structures to match actual usage
   - Make the common case obvious
